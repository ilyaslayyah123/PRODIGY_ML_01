# House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **house prices** based on various features such as **location, number of rooms, area, and other property attributes**. The model uses **machine learning algorithms** to analyze historical data and make accurate price estimations.

## 🗂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **various features** related to house prices.
- Common features include:
  - Square footage
  - Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
  - Location (latitude & longitude)
  - Year built
  - Nearby amenities
- **Source:** (Mention dataset source, e.g., Kaggle's House Prices dataset)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open `model_train.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature encoding (categorical variables)
  - Scaling numerical features
- **Model Used:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## 🚀 Usage
- Run `model_train.ipynb` to train the model.
- Test the model with new house data.
- (Optional) Deploy using Flask or Streamlit.

## 📊 Results
- The best model achieved an **R² score of XX%** on the test set.
- Feature importance analysis shows that **square footage and location** are the most influential factors.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Add more features (e.g., economic indicators, crime rates)
- Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions
